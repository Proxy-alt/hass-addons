# Releasing

This repository ships three separately-versioned artifacts. Releasing one
does not imply releasing the others.

| Artifact | Branch | Version lives in | Changelog | Distribution | Tag prefix |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `cync-lan` core protocol library | `core` | `pyproject.toml`'s `version` | `CHANGELOG.md` (on `core`) | PyPI, via Trusted Publishing | `cync-lan-vX.Y.Z` |
| `cync-lan-mqtt` Docker/MQTT add-on | `python` | `pyproject.toml`'s `version` | `CHANGELOG.md` (on `python`) | PyPI, via Trusted Publishing; consumed by `hass-addons`' Docker build | `cync-lan-mqtt-vX.Y.Z` |
| Home Assistant `cync_lan` custom_component | `feature/ha-custom-component` | `custom_components/cync_lan/manifest.json`'s `version` | `custom_components/cync_lan/CHANGELOG.md` | HACS (custom repository) / GitHub Release | `vX.Y.Z` |

The HA integration depends on the core library (`manifest.json`'s
`requirements`, a normal PyPI dependency - no more vendoring); the add-on
depends on it too (`pyproject.toml`). Bumping core doesn't require bumping
either consumer, and vice versa.

## Releasing the core library (`core` branch)

1. Bump `pyproject.toml`'s `version` (semver).
2. Add a matching entry at the top of `CHANGELOG.md`, **using that exact
   version string as the `### ` heading** - the release workflow parses
   this heading out verbatim.
3. Run the test suite (`pytest tests/`) and confirm it passes before
   pushing - the release workflow also runs it as a gate before tagging or
   publishing, but don't rely on CI to catch something you could've caught
   locally first.
4. Commit and push to `core`.

Tagging, the GitHub release, and the actual PyPI publish are all
automated from there - see "Automated releases + PyPI publishing"
below.

## Releasing the add-on (`python` branch)

1. Bump `pyproject.toml`'s `version`.
2. If the change also requires a newer core version, bump the
   `cync-lan>=X.Y.Z` line in `dependencies` too.
3. Add a matching entry at the top of `CHANGELOG.md`, same heading
   requirement as above.
4. Commit and push to `python`.

## Releasing the Home Assistant custom_component (HACS)

1. Bump `custom_components/cync_lan/manifest.json`'s `version` field.
2. If the change also requires a newer core version, bump the
   `cync-lan>=X.Y.Z` line in `manifest.json`'s `requirements` too.
3. Add a new entry at the top of `custom_components/cync_lan/CHANGELOG.md`,
   above the previous entry, **using that exact version string as the
   `### ` heading**. Write it for users, not as a commit-log dump: group
   related changes, explain what changed in practice, and call out
   anything experimental or unconfirmed the same way existing entries do.
4. Update `custom_components/cync_lan/README.md` if the release adds new
   entities, services, or configuration options - it should always describe
   the integration as it exists *right now*, not as of some earlier version.
5. Run the full test suite (`pytest tests/components/cync_lan/`) against
   the installed `cync-lan` package (not a vendored copy - there isn't one
   anymore) and confirm it passes before pushing.
6. Commit and push to `feature/ha-custom-component`.

### Which branch HACS tracks

`feature/ha-custom-component` is the repository's **default branch**, so HACS
tracks it. A custom-repository install picks the integration up normally, and
a tagged GitHub Release here is offered to existing installs as an update.

This used to be the other way round: the default was `python`, HACS 2.0 has
never supported pointing a custom repository at a non-default branch, and the
integration was effectively manual-install only. Making this branch the
default is what fixed it - so if the default is ever moved back, HACS installs
break silently and that has to be handled first.

Only the integration's releases are marked **Latest** (see the `--latest` flags
in the workflows). That matters more than it looks: three artifacts share this
repository's release list, and HACS resolves whichever release is Latest, so
Latest has to stay on the integration.

## Automated releases + PyPI publishing

Each branch has its own workflow that watches for a push changing its
version file:

- `core` branch: `.github/workflows/publish_pypi_core.yml`
- `python` branch: `.github/workflows/publish_pypi_addon.yml`
- `feature/ha-custom-component` branch: `.github/workflows/prerelease_ha_integration.yml`

(The HA file is still named `prerelease_*` so the Actions tab keeps its run
history, which GitHub keys by file path. It cuts full releases.)

### Release vs prerelease

Decided from the version string alone, by each workflow's "Classify the
version" step. There is no flag or manual toggle:

| Version   | Result                          |
|-----------|---------------------------------|
| `2.3.0`   | full release                    |
| `2.3.0b1` | prerelease (a beta)             |
| anything else | **the run fails**           |

Anything that matches neither shape is a hard error, so a typo like `2.3.O`
or `2.3` fails loudly instead of quietly shipping as the wrong kind.

Two things to know:

- **`bN` means digits, and it is the same rule for all three artifacts.**
  `0.4.0b1`, `0.4.0b2`, and so on. This is not a style preference: the two
  PyPI packages must carry valid PEP 440 versions, and PEP 440's
  pre-release segment is `b` followed by a *number*. A commit sha is
  rejected - `packaging.version.Version("0.4.0b2aad577")` raises
  `InvalidVersion`, and the upload would fail *after* the tag and GitHub
  release already existed. (`0.4.0+2aad577` parses, but PyPI refuses local
  versions on upload, so that is no escape hatch either.) The HA
  integration is not on PyPI and could technically embed a sha, but it
  follows the same rule anyway - one rule for three artifacts beats an
  exception nobody remembers.
- **Betas do not need a CHANGELOG entry**; full releases still do (see
  step 3 below). Betas get a generated stub instead, so a quick `bN` build
  does not need a changelog edit to get out the door.

This used to be `--prerelease` unconditionally, on the reasoning that
nothing here had reached a "stable" designation. That cost more than it
bought: **HACS hides prereleases** unless the user ticks the beta box
per-repository, so the normal install path saw no versions at all. All 25
pre-existing releases were converted to full releases when this changed.

On a matching push, each workflow:

1. Reads the new version out of the version file.
2. Checks whether a tag for that version already exists (`git ls-remote
   --tags`) - if so, does nothing.
3. Extracts that version's own section out of the matching `CHANGELOG.md`
   (the `### <version>` heading must match the version file *exactly*, or
   this step fails loudly rather than silently publishing an empty/wrong
   release). Betas are exempt, per above.
4. Tags the current commit and creates a GitHub Release from it via `gh
   release create`, passing `--prerelease` or `--latest` / `--latest=false`
   according to the table above. Only the HA integration is ever marked
   **Latest**: three independently-versioned artifacts share one release
   list, and Latest should be the thing HACS surfaces rather than whichever
   tag happens to be newest by date.
5. **`core` and `python` only**: runs the test suite (core branch only, no
   dedicated test suite exists for the add-on yet) and, if the tag was
   newly created, builds and publishes to PyPI via Trusted Publishing (no
   stored API token - PyPI trusts these specific GitHub Actions workflow
   runs directly). This requires a PyPI "pending publisher" configured
   once, per package, in PyPI's web UI (Account Settings -> Publishing):
   repo `Proxy-alt/cync-lan`, workflow filename `publish_pypi_core.yml` /
   `publish_pypi_addon.yml`, environment `pypi-core` / `pypi-mqtt`
   respectively.

All three are also `workflow_dispatch`-triggerable from the Actions tab,
for a manual re-run (e.g. if a push happened before the version file
finished propagating, or to retry after a transient failure) without
needing an empty commit.

**Interaction with `container-package-publish.yml`**: that workflow
(on the `python` branch) triggers on `release: published` to build/push
the Docker image, and a prerelease still counts as "published" - it fires
for every release *and* prerelease any of the three workflows above
create, not just the add-on's own. Its `build` job is guarded
(`if: ... startsWith(github.event.release.tag_name, 'cync-lan-mqtt-v')`)
so it only actually runs for the add-on's own `cync-lan-mqtt-v*` releases
- not the HA integration's `v*` ones, and not the core library's own
unrelated `cync-lan-v*` ones (a non-Docker artifact). Keep this guard in
mind if any tag prefix ever changes.

## Keeping `hass-addons` in sync

`hass-addons/cync-lan/` (the Home Assistant *App*/add-on packaging,
distinct from all three artifacts above) installs `cync-lan-mqtt` from
PyPI in its `Dockerfile`, and separately vendors this repository's
`python` branch in via `git subtree` under `cync-lan/upstream/` for
docs/changelog reference (refreshed automatically by a scheduled GitHub
Actions workflow in that repository - not the actual runtime install
path). Its `CHANGELOG.md` and `README.md` device-support claims should
track whatever this repository's own root `CHANGELOG.md`/
`docs/known_devices.md` say - if you find them out of sync, check whether
that workflow has been failing before manually reconciling the two.
