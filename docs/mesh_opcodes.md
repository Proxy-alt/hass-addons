# Mesh command opcodes

This documents the *inner* BTLE-mesh command layer — the `op_code`/`cmd_code`/`sub_id`/payload
that travels inside a `0x73` data-channel packet (see [packet_structure.md](packet_structure.md)
for the outer TCP framing that wraps it). Everything here follows the same envelope pattern
cync-lan already uses in `src/cync_lan/devices.py`: `send_command(op, cmd_, sub_id, payload, ...)`,
built by `PacketBuilder.build_control_packet()` (`src/cync_lan/packet/builder.py:205`).

Sourcing conventions used throughout this doc, matching the existing standard set by
`devices.py`'s `_build_motion_sensor_settings_payload` docstring:
- **confirmed** — cited to an exact decompiled-app class/line, or proven from a real packet
  capture, or already shipping in production.
- **plausible** — a reasonable inference from decompiled evidence, not directly proven.
- **not found / blocked** — explicitly flagged as absent, not guessed at.

### Source trees

Two different decompiles are cited across this repo's docs, and they are not interchangeable:

- **v1** — `cync_decompiled/`. The original jadx run. Everything in this doc dated 2026-07-16
  (background agents, cross-referenced against this repo's own `src/cync_lan/devices.py`) is
  against v1.
- **v2** — `cync_decompiled_v2/`. A re-decompile with anti-inlining flags, which recovers method
  bodies v1 had inlined away. `ble_provisioning_protocol.md` and the "Hub command family"
  section below are against v2. v2 also carries ~60 files of inline
  `[cync-lan reverse-engineering note ...]` comments recording earlier analysis.

Cite class paths relative to a tree's `sources/` root — e.g.
`sources/com/gelighting/cbygekit/services/devices/command/AddAutomationHubCommand.java` — rather
than by absolute local path, and say which tree. Neither tree is in version control, so a claim
that cannot be re-derived from a class path is a claim that will not survive losing the folder.
Line numbers in older sections refer to v1 and will not match v2; the class and field names do.

## The `cmd_code` mystery — resolved, see "TCP relay envelope research" below

Every *new* command researched below hit the same wall: the decompiled Android app's BTLE-mesh
command classes (`com/gelighting/cbygekit/services/devices/command/*.java`) only ever expose a
3-4 byte **inner mesh opcode array** (e.g. `{0xF7, 0x11, 0x02, 0x07}` for motion-sensor settings) —
there is no field in that layer corresponding to cync-lan's own `cmd_code`.

`PacketBuilder.build_control_packet()` shows where `cmd_code` actually lives structurally:

```
header  = [msg_id][0x00 0x00 0x00][0xF8][op_code][cmd_code][0x00]   # 8 bytes
routing = [msg_id][0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00][target_id][sub_id]           # 7 bytes
inner   = header + routing + [op_code] + command_payload
```

`cmd_code` sits immediately after `op_code` in cync-lan's own inner-packet header — this is
**cync-lan's own wrapper framing**, not part of the BTLE mesh command itself. That's consistent
with why the phone app's BTLE-mesh command classes never mention it: the app talks BTLE GATT
directly to a device; cync-lan (and, presumably, the real WiFi-bridge firmware) instead relays
mesh commands over TCP, and `cmd_code` is very likely specific to *that* relay/tunneling layer,
not the mesh command payload.

**Resolved** — see "TCP relay envelope research" immediately below: `cmd_code` is a payload-length
field, not a semantic command code. The `set_brightness`/`set_temperature`/`set_rgb` overlap at
`cmd_code = 0x10` isn't a "response category" as originally hypothesized here — it's simply that
all three happen to share the same 8-byte payload length. Left the original hypothesis text out of
this doc entirely rather than keeping a disproven guess around; see the section below for the
actual mechanism and formula.

## TCP relay envelope research

Found the app's TCP-relay outer-envelope builder the earlier BTLE-only search missed: it lives
under `com/gelighting/cbygekit/services/devices/xlink/` (the "xlink" IoT-relay SDK layer, not the
`services/devices/command/` BTLE package). `XlinkDeviceManager.CommandDelegate` implements
`XlinkCommandDelegate` (`XlinkCommandDelegate.java:49-61`, methods `f`/`g`/`h`) and is what every
command class ultimately calls (`ControlDeviceGroupCommand.java:159`,
`SetComboCommand.java:130`, etc., via `xlinkCommandDelegate.f((byte) op_code, commandBody,
meshAddress, ...)` — the `byte` argument here is confirmed to literally be `op_code`: `-41`=`0xD7`
for groups, `-16`=`0xF0` for `SetComboCommand`, matching the doc's confirmed table exactly).

`CommandDelegate.f()` (`XlinkDeviceManager.java:1010-1026`) prepends a 7-byte routing prefix
(3-byte msgId LE + 2 zero bytes + 2-byte destination `MeshAddress` LE) to `commandBody`
(op_code byte + sub-opcode/payload — the same array already documented above), then calls
`g()` → `Xlink.a(byte op_code, byte[] data, int msgId)` (`Xlink.java:23-70`), which builds:
`[msgId(4B LE)][0xF8][op_code(1B)][length(2B LE)][data][checksum]`, then 0x7E-delimits and
byte-stuffs it (0x7D/0x7E escaping) — an HDLC-style framing, **confirmed** distinct from
cync-lan's own captured 5-byte-header wire format in `packet_structure.md` (no delimiters/
escaping there). The `0xF8` marker is a real constant (`com.thingclips.sdk.bluetooth.pdqbbbp.
dpdqppp = 248`), and this whole `io.xlink.wifi.sdk`/`xlink.legacy` pathway carries a `@Deprecated`
tag on its writer thread (`TcpPacketWriter.java:13`) — so this is very likely the phone-app's
older command channel, not necessarily byte-identical to the device-facing protocol cync-lan
replicates. Flagging as **plausible**, not confirmed, for that reason.

**The payoff**: the 2 bytes right after `op_code` in this header are not a semantic field at all —
they're `WriteBuffer.d(length)` (`xlink/legacy/WriteBuffer.java:41-44`), the little-endian **byte
length of `data`** (7-byte routing prefix + `commandBody`). Testing `cmd_code = 7 + len(commandBody)`
against all three already-confirmed production values below reproduces them exactly:
`set_power`: 7 + (1 op_code + 5B payload) = 13 = `0x0D` ✓. `set_brightness`/`set_rgb`: 7 + (1 + 8B)
= 16 = `0x10` ✓. `set_lightshow`: 7 + (1 + 6B) = 14 = `0x0E` ✓. The doc's fixed trailing `0x00` byte
is simply the length field's high byte, zero because no mesh payload is anywhere near 256 bytes.
This gives a directly testable formula for every "blocked" command above (e.g. scenes `0xEF`:
7+(1+4B `[0x11,0x02,sceneId,0x01]`)=`0x0C`; fine-brightness `0xE2`: 7+(1+7B)=`0x0F`) — cheap to
verify against a live capture, much stronger than a blind guess. Apply this formula to every
command flagged "blocked: `cmd_code`" below before assuming a capture is required.

## Confirmed, already shipping in production

Extracted directly from `src/cync_lan/devices.py` (not decompiled-app-sourced — these already
work against real hardware).

| Command | `op_code` | `cmd_code` | Payload shape | Source |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `set_power` | `0xD0` | `0x0D` | `[0x11, 0x02, state, 0x00, 0x00]` (5B) | `devices.py:770` |
| `set_brightness` | `0xF0` (`0xD2` if sol-lamp) | `0x10` | non-sol: `[0x11,0x02,0x01,bri,0xFF,0xFF,0xFF,0xFF]` (8B); sol: `[0x11,0x02,bri,0x00,0x00]` (5B) | `devices.py:790` |
| `set_temperature` | `0xF0` (`0xE2` if sol-lamp) | `0x10` | non-sol: `[0x11,0x02,0x01,0xFF,temp,0x00,0x00,0x00]` (8B); sol: `[0x11,0x02,0x05,temp,0x00]` (5B) | `devices.py:817` |
| `set_rgb` | `0xF0` | `0x10` | `[0x11,0x02,0x01,0xFF,0xFE,r,g,b]` (8B) | `devices.py:844` |
| `set_lightshow` (factory presets only) | `0xE2` | `0x0E` | `[0x11,0x02,0x07,0x01,byte1,byte2]` (6B) — `0x07` = light-run-mode sub-cmd, `0x01` = hardcoded `MODE_LIGHT_SHOW` | `devices.py:870` |

Note the `cmd_code = 0x10` overlap across brightness/temperature/rgb despite three different
`op_code`s — explained by the length-field formula in "TCP relay envelope research" above
(all three share the same 8-byte payload length), not a semantic coincidence.

## Provenance of already-confirmed cmd_code values

Mystery solved for all five: every `cmd_code` in the table above traces to a **real socat-MITM
packet capture**, not decompiled-app inference — the decompiled-app search came up empty precisely
because `cmd_code` genuinely isn't in that layer (per "The `cmd_code` mystery" above); it was only
ever knowable from a live capture, and one was already done, years before this doc.

- **`set_power` = `0x0D`** — confirmed: a full socat session log,
  `docs/debugging_sessions/3 devices/Plug - Toggle Power/{Plug,App}.md` (captured 2024/03/11),
  shows six raw power-toggle packets from the real Cync Android app, e.g. `Plug.md:255`:
  `... f8 d0 0d 00 21 00 00 00 00 05 00 d0 11 02 01 00 00 e7 ...` — `f8` then `d0` (`op_code`) then
  `0d` (`cmd_code`), matching `PacketBuilder.build_control_packet()`'s header layout exactly.
- **`set_brightness`/`set_temperature`/`set_rgb` = `0x10`** — confirmed: raw hex dumps embedded as
  docstring comments in pre-refactor `devices.py`, each annotated with the sender's own checksum
  arithmetic (proving they're real captures, not authored examples), all showing `f8 f0 10 ...`:
  `set_brightness` at commit `8e9623a:src/cync_lan/devices.py:405-407`
  (`f8 f0 10 00 17 ... f0 11 02 01 27 ff ff ff ff 45`); `set_temperature` at
  `8e9623a:src/cync_lan/devices.py:503-506`; `set_rgb` at
  `7cd035c:src/cync_lan/devices.py:693-697` (`f8 f0 10 00 2b ... f0 11 02 01 ff fe 00 fb ff`,
  checksum verified as `2d`). Commit `7cd035c` ("Merge pull request #31 from tobyroworth/device-151",
  2026-05-17) is the last commit before the `096b735` "proxy/mitm" refactor stripped these comments
  when reformatting these commands onto the current `op`/`cmd_`/`send_command()` pattern.
- **`set_lightshow` = `0x0E`** — confirmed: same pre-refactor file,
  `7cd035c:src/cync_lan/devices.py:794-841`, ten separate raw captures (one per factory effect:
  candle, rainbow, cyber, fireworks, volcanic, aurora, happy holidays, red-white-blue, vegas, party
  time), all `f8 e2 0e ...`.

Upstream lead, not needed given the above: this repo's `python` branch was itself imported via
commit `8e9623a` ("initial import of lib code from HASS with touch ups") from a HASS custom
component predecessor; `git remote -v` shows `upstream -> baudneo/cync-lan`, and `README.md`
credits a further-upstream fork chain (`iburistu/cync-lan`, `juanboro/cync2mqtt`) — the original
capture sessions likely predate this repo entirely, but the evidence already in-tree above is
sufficient on its own.

**UPDATE**: wired into a real, EXPERIMENTAL send as of this session's later work (see below) - the
predicted `cmd_code = 0x13` (corrected from an earlier miscounted 9-byte/lower-value estimate; the
real payload is 11 bytes, `">BBBHHB"` is 8 bytes not 6). Exposed as the
`cync_lan.experimental_set_motion_sensor_settings` HA service.

**Operational prerequisite, RESOLVED**: the real Cync app requires physically waking the sensor
first (hold the off button ~5s until the LED turns green) before it accepts settings edits -
confirmed this gate is just the device's ordinary online/offline mesh status (the same signal
`bridge.is_online(dev_id)` already tracks), not a BLE/GATT discoverability scan, and no
programmatic wake command exists. See "Operational prerequisite: motion sensors must be woken
before settings/schedule writes" further below for the full research trail.

**UPDATE 2, this session**: the `0xF7` below is **not** cync-lan's outer `op_code` - see the
"CORRECTION" section further down. The real outer op is `0x8E`; `0xF7` is the payload's own
leading discriminator byte. Fixed in `devices.py`; `cmd_code` is unchanged (`0x13`).

| Command | `op_code` (confirmed) | `cmd_code` | Payload shape (confirmed) | Source |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Motion/ambient-light sensor settings | `0x8E` (payload leads with `0xF7`, see CORRECTION below) | `0x13` (**predicted**, not confirmed against a live capture) | `[0xF7, 0x11, 0x02, 0x07, type_discriminator(1=motion,2=ambient), enabled, sensitivity, delay_s, deactivation_s, ...]` (12B total, incl. the leading `0xF7` discriminator now sent as payload) | `devices.py`'s `_build_motion_sensor_settings_payload`/`set_motion_sensor_settings`, decompiled: `SetMotionSensorSettingsCommand.java` opcode array `{-9,17,2,7}`, cross-checked twice |

## Protocol commands beyond the original confirmed set

**UPDATE**: the "TCP relay envelope research" section above resolved the `cmd_code` mystery with a
length formula, validated 3/3 against production commands. Fine/fade brightness, indicator LED,
scenes, and motion/ambient sensor settings (below) are now wired into real, EXPERIMENTAL sends
using `cmd_code` values *predicted* by that formula - not independently confirmed against a live
capture. Each is exposed as a `cync_lan.experimental_*` HA service (see
`custom_components/cync_lan/services.py`), named and documented as experimental so a wrong
prediction is easy to diagnose and doesn't look like a normal confirmed feature. Light-run-mode
(below) needed no such caveat - it reuses `set_lightshow`'s already-confirmed `cmd_code`.

### CORRECTION (real-hardware test, this session): the `0xF7`/`0xEF` "op_code" for 3 commands was never a real outer op

**Update: the fix below is confirmed working** - the user re-tested `set_indicator_led` after this
correction and it now works on real hardware. See the "Indicator LED ring" section further down.

A real-hardware test of `set_indicator_led` (the "ring light" feature) came back a total no-op -
no error, device did nothing (fire-and-forget, no ACK checked, so a wrong guess just silently
vanishes). Root cause, traced by a background research agent digging into the decompiled app's
actual send path: `SetStatusIndicatorSettingsCommand`, `SetMotionSensorSettingsCommand`, and
`ExecuteSceneCommand` **do not pass their "opcode array"'s first byte as an outer op_code at all**.
Their `N()`/send method calls `XlinkCommandDelegate.DefaultImpls.c(...)` with the *entire* opcode
array as one opaque `commandBody` (no separate op argument) → `XlinkDeviceManager.CommandDelegate.h()`
(`XlinkDeviceManager.java:1050-1051`) hardcodes the real outer op: `f((byte) -114, bArr, ...)` =
**`op_code = 0x8E`**, a generic "mesh-relay" op shared across all three commands (and likely others -
`SetMotionSensorScheduleCommand.java:129-130` routes through the identical path). What we'd been
reading as "`op_code = 0xF7`/`0xEF`, payload starts `0x11 0x02 ...`" is actually "`op_code = 0x8E`,
payload starts `0xF7`/`0xEF` (the array's real first byte) `0x11 0x02 ...`" - the array's first byte
was never our envelope's op, it's the payload's own leading discriminator byte.

**Independently confirmed**, not just from static decompiled-source tracing: a genuine captured
packet, `docs/debugging_sessions/3 devices/Plug - Toggle Power/Plug.md:226`
(`f8 8e 0b 00 20 00 00 00 00 ff ff f7 11 02 21 e2`), decodes byte-for-byte against
`PacketBuilder.build_control_packet(msg_id=0x20, target_id=0xFF, sub_id=0xFF, op_code=0x8E,
cmd_code=0x0B, command_payload=[0xF7,0x11,0x02,0x21], repeat_op_code=False)` - checksum included
(verified: `sum(0x8e,0x0b,0x00,0x20,0x00,0x00,0x00,0x00,0xff,0xff,0xf7,0x11,0x02,0x21) % 256 ==
0xe2`, matching the captured checksum exactly). This is a genuine, different real command (a plug
power toggle, not indicator LED) that happens to share the same `0x8E` op family with a
`0xF7 0x11 0x02`-prefixed payload - strong evidence `0x8E` is real, shared infrastructure, not
specific to one feature.

**A second, structural bug this exposed**: `PacketBuilder.build_control_packet()` unconditionally
inserted a repeated standalone `op_code` byte between the routing section and the payload - true
for every op family confirmed so far (`0xD0`/`0xF0`/`0xE2`), but the real capture above only
balances its checksum with **no** such byte for the `0x8E` family. Added a `repeat_op_code: bool =
True` parameter (default preserves all existing confirmed commands unchanged) - `False` for `0x8E`.

**Net effect on the numbers already in this doc**: `cmd_code` predictions are *unchanged* -
prepending the real discriminator byte into the payload (rather than "spending" it as a fake op)
and dropping the phantom repeated-op-byte cancel out exactly in the length formula (e.g. indicator
LED: old `7+1+6B=0x0E` vs new `7+7B=0x0E`, same value). Only `op_code` (now `0x8E` for all three)
and the payload's leading byte (now literally present as data - `0xF7` for indicator LED/motion
settings, `0xEF` for scenes) changed. Fixed in `devices.py`'s `set_indicator_led()`,
`set_motion_sensor_settings()`, and `execute_scene()`. **UPDATE**: motion-sensor schedule write
(`0x0B`, documented further below) has since been wired in too - `set_motion_sensor_schedule()`
has the identical correction applied (confirmed via the same `SetMotionSensorScheduleCommand`
class, same `DefaultImpls.c`→`h()` path), same as its siblings above.

### Fine/fade brightness — `op_code = 0xE2`, sub-command `0x08`

**WIRED IN, EXPERIMENTAL**: `devices.py`'s `set_fine_brightness()`, `cmd_code = 0x0F` (predicted).
Exposed via HA's standard `light.turn_on(transition=...)` (no custom service needed - `ATTR_TRANSITION`
was unused anywhere in this integration before, so this can't regress any existing automation).

Extends the same command family `set_lightshow` already uses (`0xE2` outer, `0x11 0x02` prefix).

- Payload after `[0x11, 0x02, 0x08]`: `brightness × 10` as **big-endian u16** (0–1000, i.e. tenths
  of a percent) + fade duration in **milliseconds** as **big-endian u16** (max ~65.5s).
- HA's `light.turn_on(transition=...)` (seconds) maps directly: `fade_ms = round(transition * 1000)`.
- Confirmed: `SetFineBrightnessCommand.java` line 49 (`f20525r = {-30,17,2,8}`), payload builder
  `x()` lines 120-129, `writeShort` calls read directly (no decompiler ambiguity on byte layout).
- `cmd_code = 0x0F` is **predicted**, not confirmed against a live capture - via the length formula
  in "TCP relay envelope research" above.
- Adjacent, unrelated: `SetBrightnessCommand.java` (`{-46,17,2}` = `0xD2 0x11 0x02`, plain 0-100
  int, no fade) — a *different*, coarser opcode family, not needed since cync-lan's existing
  `set_brightness` already works.

### Full light-run-mode incl. MultiColor/MusicShow — `op_code = 0xE2`, sub-command `0x07`

**WIRED IN, not experimental** — no `cmd_code` risk here, it reuses `set_lightshow`'s
already-confirmed `cmd_code = 0x0E`. `devices.py`'s `set_light_effect()` + `const.py`'s
`LIGHT_RUN_MODE_EFFECTS` cover all 5 modes; exposed via the light entity's normal `effect`
attribute/`effect_list`, same as the original LightShow-only presets. The third payload byte
("randomNonce") is confirmed genuinely random and unvalidated by the receiving device
(`SetLightRunModeCommand.java:124`: `Random.nextInt()` on every real send) - a constant `0x00` is
safe for every new preset, no captured value needed.

Payload after `[0x11, 0x02, 0x07]` is `[modeCode, index, randomNonce]` — cync-lan's current
`set_lightshow` hardcodes `modeCode = 0x01` (`LIGHT_SHOW`). Confirmed mode values
(`LightRunMode.java` lines 55-59, each with a `super(N)` call fixing its constant):

| `modeCode` | Mode | Index range | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `0x00` | Static | always `0` | |
| `0x01` | LightShow | 1-9, 65-67 (factory), 10-32 (custom) | cync-lan's current only mode, matches existing `FACTORY_EFFECTS_BYTES` |
| `0x02` | MusicShow | 1-8, 65 (factory), 10-32 (custom) | **Not raw audio data** — device does audio-reactivity locally via its own mic; the wire command just selects a preset index, identical mechanism to LightShow |
| `0x03` | Reveal | always `0` | |
| `0x04` | MultiColor | 1-2 (factory), 3-32 (custom) | *activating* a saved scheme only — see below for uploading custom scheme data |

Source: `SetLightRunModeCommand.java` (opcode `q = {-30,17,2,7}`), `x()` lines 108-126;
`LightShow.java`, `MusicShow.java`, `Reveal.java`, `MultiColor.java` (index-range constants via
`super(N)`/`IntRange(...)`).

**UPDATE, follow-up pass on "Reveal" specifically** - re-confirmed `set_light_effect("reveal")`
(modeCode `0x03`) is the real app's dedicated Reveal toggle button
(`RevealFragment.i0()`→`LightControlViewModel.p()`→`Command.SetLightRunMode`), already fully wired
in `devices.py`, nothing further needed for it. **A second, separate, real code path exists that
is NOT wired in** and is redundant with the above: selecting Reveal via the app's color-tab picker
sends it through the everyday `SetComboCommand` (op `0xF0`) instead, with a 2-byte (not 4-byte)
color-type sentinel `[0xFF, 0xF0]` in place of the usual CCT `[pct,0,0,0]`/RGB `[0xFE,r,g,b]` shape
(`SetComboCommand.java:816-818`; the singleton `RevealColor` object carries no Full-Color-vs-
Soft-White distinction - that's purely the bulb's own SKU/firmware, not a wire field, per
`ProductModel.java:137-171`'s per-SKU Reveal entries). `SetComboCommand` explicitly rejects
`RevealColor` for hub-relayed devices (`"RevealColor is not supported by hubs"`,
`SetComboCommand.java:339,421,532,614,705`) - only works over direct XLink mesh. Since this path
produces the same end-user effect as the already-wired `set_light_effect("reveal")`, it's
documented here for completeness but not worth implementing as a second way to do the same thing.

**Custom MultiColor scheme creation** (uploading arbitrary per-segment RGB data, not just
activating a saved one) is a **separate, unrelated opcode**: `SetMultiColorSegmentsCommand.java`,
`{0xF7, 0x11, 0x02, 0x4E}` — payload is a gradient-mode toggle, segment count, or up to 2 segments
per packet as `[position_or_255, R, G, B]`.

**SHIPPED, EXPERIMENTAL**: `devices.py`'s `CyncDevice.set_multicolor_gradient_mode()`/
`set_multicolor_segment_count()`/`set_multicolor_segments()` implement these 3 confirmed wire
primitives exactly (dispatched via the same non-hub `0x8E`-relay-bug family as add_to_scene/
set_indicator_led/etc, per `SetMultiColorSegmentsCommand.mo14023N()`'s
`XlinkCommandDelegate.DefaultImpls.c()` call - no product-family branch exists for this command at
all, unlike add_to_scene/set_group_membership/remove_from_scene). Per-segment position and color
are confirmed INDEPENDENTLY nullable (`MultiColorSegmentData.java`'s own two separately-`@Nullable`
fields) - position defaults to the `0xFF` sentinel, color defaults to `0,0,0`, not tied together.
Position's `1-120` range is a literal confirmed directly in `SegmentData`'s own bounds check, not
inferred. What's **not** wired in, and not just a matter of exposing another primitive:
this project does not orchestrate the multi-send SEQUENCE a real custom scheme needs (what order
the app sends gradient-mode/count/segment-data in across possibly many chunked sends for >2
segments, and any timing between them, isn't traced from the decompiled source) - callers
must chunk/sequence themselves.

Also `SetMultiColorSchemeDirectCommand.java` (xlink `0x89`, "entertainment"/live-streaming variant)
and `SetMultiColorBitmapCommand.java` (tile/matrix bitmap data for other product types) remain
**out of scope, not just untested** - both dispatch via methods (`m14393b`/`m14027t`) never traced
anywhere else in this research, structurally distinct from every other confirmed command family in
this file, and "entertainment"/live-streaming framing strongly implies a continuous low-latency
protocol rather than a one-shot command - a materially bigger feature than exposing another
primitive, unlike the 3 `SetMultiColorSegmentsCommand` primitives above.

Related for a future scene-export feature: `AddDeviceSceneCommand.java` (`{-18,17,2}` =
`0xEE 0x11 0x02`) documents the 6-byte per-device state block scenes store
(`mode, brightness/param, color-temp-or-254-for-RGB, R, G, B`).

**UPDATE, follow-up pass - full payload including the Schedule "fade" feature resolved.**
`AddDeviceSceneCommand` is what actually programs a device's on-device scene-slot state -
called once when a scene (or the implicit per-device scene backing a simple Schedule) is
created/edited, not at trigger time. Two payload shapes depending on device routing:

- **Non-hub-routed devices** (`AddDeviceSceneCommand.java:186-192,279-284`): `[0xEE,0x11,0x02] +
  [actionTypeByte, sceneNum] + [mode, param, colorType, R, G, B] (the 6-byte block above) +
  [fadeByte, 0xFF]` - 13 bytes. **This is the same `0x8E`-relay bug class as indicator LED/motion
  settings**: dispatched via `XlinkCommandDelegate.DefaultImpls.c` → `h()` →
  `XlinkDeviceManager.CommandDelegate.h()` (`XlinkDeviceManager.java:1050-1053`), which hardcodes
  outer op `(byte)-114` = `0x8E` - the embedded `0xEE` is not the real outer op_code, exactly like
  the already-confirmed siblings. **Shipped**: `devices.py`'s `CyncDevice.add_to_scene(scene_id,
  cct=, rgb=, fade=, sub_id=)` implements this exact path with the `0x8E` fix applied; the
  Hub-routed shape below is not implemented (logs an error instead of guessing at an unconfirmed
  format).
- **Hub-routed devices** (`AddDeviceSceneCommand.java:193-251`): a manually-built `WriteBuffer`
  frame with `FrameCode` headers + an explicit little-endian `MeshAddress` target, dispatched via
  the raw pre-framed `e()` method (same dispatch class as the pure Hub Scenes/Schedules commands
  elsewhere in this doc) - a structurally different payload from the non-hub path above, not just
  a different op_code.

**`RemoveDeviceSceneCommand`** (the counterpart - removing a device's captured state from a scene
without deleting the scene) is simpler and, unlike `AddDeviceSceneCommand`, has **both** branches
confirmed and shipped: opcode array `{0xEE,0x11,0x02,0x00}` (fixed trailing `0x00` - no actionType/
mode/color/fade fields, since there's nothing to configure) + sceneId (1 byte) = 5 bytes.
Non-hub-routed devices hit the same `0x8E`-relay substitution as `AddDeviceSceneCommand`'s non-hub
path. Hub-routed devices (`is_sol_lamp`) turned out to route through the same trustworthy
`mo14054f()` envelope already confirmed for `set_group_membership()`'s `is_sol_lamp` branch - a
real op_code `0xEE`, not the manually-built `WriteBuffer`/`FrameCode` frame that blocks
`AddDeviceSceneCommand`'s hub path. **Shipped**: `devices.py`'s
`CyncDevice.remove_from_scene(scene_id, sub_id=)` implements both branches.

**The fade byte** (`ScheduleFade.java:25-32`, 1-byte signed enum): `NO_FADE=-1(0xFF)`,
`FADE_10_SECONDS=1`, `FADE_30_SECONDS=2`, `FADE_1_MINUTE=3`, `FADE_5_MINUTES=4`,
`FADE_10_MINUTES=5`, `FADE_20_MINUTES=6`, `FADE_30_MINUTES=7` - a coded duration bucket, not raw
seconds. It's a field on `SceneModel` (`SceneModel.java:47-48`), not on the Schedule command
itself - `CreateScheduleHubCommand`'s own payload has no fade byte at all
(`CreateScheduleHubCommand.java:59-68`); every Schedule (even a single-device one) is internally
an implicit `SceneModel` under the hood (`ScheduleServiceDefault$createDevicesSchedule*` classes),
so this mechanism does cover schedules despite living on the Scene side. **Confirmed hardware-side,
not a software ramp**: `ExecuteSceneCommand` (what a schedule trigger actually fires) never resends
color or fade data for real scenes (`ExecuteSceneCommand.java:137-144,198-207`) - it just
references the `SceneId`, meaning the bulb's own firmware executes the fade autonomously using the
byte it received once at scene-programming time. Not general-purpose: `SetComboCommand.y()` (the
everyday brightness/color-set command) has no fade field anywhere in its payload - fade only
exists via the Scene/Schedule-programming path above.

**Shipped** as `add_to_scene()`'s `fade` parameter (default `0xFF`/`NO_FADE`) - not blocked by the
Hub-commands transport question (`docs/cync_automations.md`) since this non-hub-routed path is
confirmed to ride the same `mo14054f`/`mo14056h` methods already proven to carry real TCP-relay
traffic.

Also relevant: `SetLightRunModeUseCase.java` shows the app validates custom show/scheme existence
via the cloud before sending, and for multi-device groups allocates a temporary index (129-255)
via `SetShowTemporaryMappingCommand` rather than sending the raw custom index directly — relevant
if cync-lan ever supports custom (non-factory) shows/schemes on groups specifically.

### Groups control — `op_code = 0xD7`

**Not what the name suggests.** This is mesh **group-membership management** (a device
subscribing/unsubscribing to a group's pub/sub address) — not "control an entire group's state in
one packet."

- Confirmed: `ControlDeviceGroupCommand.java` line 120, `f20280s = {-41,17,2}` = `{0xD7,0x11,0x02}`.
  Base class for `AddDeviceGroupCommand`/`RemoveDeviceGroupCommand`. Payload (`x()` lines 190-214):
  `action` byte (ADD=1/REMOVE=0) + 2-byte **little-endian** group address (`ExtensionsKt.f`,
  confirmed low-byte-first at `ExtensionsKt.java:83-90`) + optional `GroupReachFlag` byte
  (RX=0x87, RXTX=0x00).
- No other occurrence of opcode `0xD7` anywhere in `com/gelighting/cbygekit` (verified by grep).

**The actual "control a whole group at once" mechanism — plausible, not directly confirmed:**
`MeshAddress.java` confirms cync-lan's own group-address assumption exactly:
`GROUP_ADDRESS_RANGE = 32768 until 65535` (line 42), `groupId = address - 32768` (`f()`,
lines 146-151). `SendCommandToDeviceGroupsUseCase.java` has a `DeviceGroup.Group` variant
(alongside `IndividualDevice`/`IndividualDevices`) suggesting the app dispatches its *ordinary*
per-device commands — the same `0xD0`/`0xF0`/etc. cync-lan already implements — targeted at a
group's synthetic `MeshAddress` (32768+groupId) rather than a device address. The concrete
resolution call site was abstracted through `Result<Flow<T>>` in the decompiled source and
couldn't be traced to full confirmation.

**CORRECTION (twice), this session's later work.**

First pass looked like a dead end: `PacketBuilder.build_control_packet()`'s routing struct packs
`target_id` as a single byte (`_require_u8`, `src/cync_lan/packet/builder.py:215`) - group synthetic
addresses (32768+) can't be passed as `target_id` as-is, they'd fail validation outright. Dropped
from that round pending dedicated protocol research.

**Second pass, resolved**: `target_id` and `sub_id` were never two independent fields.
`XlinkDeviceManager.CommandDelegate.mo14054f()` (the real app's outer-envelope builder, confirmed
byte-for-byte, re-traced with fresh eyes after the earlier pass mischaracterized it as a possibly
separate/legacy code path - it isn't; `SetComboCommand`, the group-membership `0xD7` command above,
and the `0x8E`-family commands all funnel through this exact same method) writes a genuine 2-byte
little-endian `MeshAddress` destination field. Lining up byte positions: cync-lan's own
`routing = [msg_id][0000][target_id][sub_id]` is structurally identical to the app's
`[msgId_lo][msgId_mid][msgId_hi][00][00][dest_lo][dest_hi]` whenever `msg_id < 256` (mid/hi bytes
naturally zero) - meaning **`target_id` (low byte) and `sub_id` (high byte) already jointly
represent one 16-bit MeshAddress**, they just never needed to be anything but `sub_id=0` for
ordinary single-gang devices, so nobody noticed the high byte was live. Group addresses (32768-65535,
exactly cync-lan's own `group_id` dict key - see `cloud_api.py`'s `raw_group["groupID"]`) fit
entirely inside that same 16-bit space. **No `PacketBuilder` changes are needed at all** -
`_require_u8` already accepts any byte 0-255 in both fields; a caller just needs to stop hardcoding
`sub_id=0x00` and instead split a group address as `target_id = addr & 0xFF, sub_id = (addr >> 8) &
0xFF`.

**WIRED IN, EXPERIMENTAL, but unlike every other experimental command in this doc, not a `cmd_code`
guess**: `devices.py`'s `set_group_power(group_id, state)` reuses `set_power`'s exactly-confirmed
`op=0xD0`/`cmd_=0x0D`/payload byte-for-byte - the only unconfirmed thing is the addressing itself.
Two real gaps remain, honestly: (1) the one real `0x8E`-family packet capture available used
broadcast `target_id=sub_id=0xFF` (i.e. address `0xFFFF`), which is byte-identical whether you think
of it as "two independent 0xFF bytes" or "one 16-bit `0xFFFF` address" - it doesn't independently
prove the 2-byte model, the byte-layout argument above is the real evidence, not this capture; (2)
whether the app itself ever relies on a true one-packet group broadcast is still unclear -
`DeviceServiceDefault.mo13857w` ("sendMulticastCommand") takes a `Collection<DeviceId>` (individual
device IDs) and its `MulticastStrategy` enum (`CONTINUE_ON_FAILURE`/`BREAK_ON_FAILURE`) reads like
per-item loop error handling, not an addressing mode - circumstantial evidence the app fans out
per-device commands for "group" actions rather than ever sending one true group-targeted packet.
So: the wire format can *represent* a group address, cync-lan can now send one with zero new
plumbing, but whether real device firmware actually *honors* it as "respond as the whole group" has
never been tested - that's what `cync_lan.experimental_set_group_power` (`custom_components/
cync_lan/services.py`) exists to find out.

**Group MEMBERSHIP itself, WIRED IN, EXPERIMENTAL** — the actual `0xD7` `ControlDeviceGroupCommand`
described at the top of this section (add/remove a device to/from a group's pub/sub address, not
"control the group's state") is now implemented: `devices.py`'s `CyncDevice.set_group_membership
(group_id, member, reach_flag=0x00)`, exposed as `cync_lan.experimental_set_group_membership`.
Unlike every other command in this doc it targets an individual device's own address - the group
address is payload data, telling one specific device "start/stop listening on this group's
address," not a broadcast. This is genuinely new functionality cync-lan didn't have before
(creating/managing group membership, not just controlling an existing group's power) - a real step
toward managing structure, not just runtime state, from HA.

**UPDATE, corrected after follow-up research - the command is genuinely dual-path, not always
real-0xD7.** `ControlDeviceGroupCommand.mo14013g()` branches on
`xlinkCommandDelegate.getDeviceType().getProductType().f31219d` (`ControlDeviceGroupCommand.java:192`).
Traced this flag to its source: it means "is this device's `ProductType` `Sol` or `C-Reach`" -
the SDK's own internal "is this a Hub product" flag (`ProductType.java:195-199`;
`XlinkHubDeviceController`'s constructor literally asserts `if (!productType.f31219d) throw
UnsupportedDeviceTypeException(... "is not a hub")`) - **not** a generic hub-relay/BLE-vs-WiFi
distinction as originally assumed when this command was first wired in. cync-lan already tracks
the exact same distinction via `is_sol_lamp` (`metadata.opcodes.sol_lamp`, true only for device
type 80 in cync-lan's current catalog - see `is_sol_lamp`'s own docstring for the sibling
`set_brightness`/`set_temperature` special-casing this same product family already uses). The
initial implementation always took the confirmed-real-`0xD7` branch - correct only for that rare
Sol/C-Reach family. For every other real device (`is_sol_lamp=False`, virtually all real Cync
hardware), the SDK instead routes through the same `0x8E` "mesh-relay" substitution bug as
`set_indicator_led`/`set_motion_sensor_settings`/etc. - `0xD7` moves from "outer op" to "payload's
leading discriminator byte." **Now fixed**: `set_group_membership()` branches on `self.is_sol_lamp`
and sends the correct shape for either case - `op=0xD7` directly (unconfirmed `cmd_code = 8 +
6-byte payload = 0x0E`) for the rare Sol/C-Reach family, `op=0x8E` with `0xD7` prepended into a
7-byte payload (unconfirmed `cmd_code = 7 + 7 = 0x0E`, `repeat_op_code=False`) for everything else.
Neither branch's `cmd_code` has been captured against a live packet.

### Scenes control — real `op_code = 0x8E` (was wrongly `0xEF`, see CORRECTION above)

**WIRED IN, EXPERIMENTAL — the riskiest of the wired-in commands.** `devices.py`'s
`execute_scene()`, exposed via the `cync_lan.experimental_execute_scene` HA service AND (newer)
`scene.py`'s `CyncLanScene` entities (one per Cync Scene, sourced from `parse_scenes()` - see
`cync_automations.md`'s "Recommendation" item 4), targeting the "Cync LAN Bridge" device
(identifiers=(DOMAIN, entry_id), no per-device target - Scenes are home-wide) rather than an
individual device. **Not yet real-hardware tested after the `0x8E`
correction** (only `set_indicator_led`, its sibling in the same command family, has been tested and
confirmed broken/now-fixed - see CORRECTION above). Two independent guesses still compound here:
`cmd_code = 0x0C` (predicted via the length formula) *and* `target_id = 0x00` (guessed as
`MeshAddress`'s documented "none/self/unassigned" sentinel - the real captured packet that
confirmed `0x8E` used a `target_id`/`sub_id` of `0xFF`/`0xFF` instead, for its own broadcast-style
command, so this specific guess is still unconfirmed either way). Flagged most prominently in its
service description for this reason.

- Confirmed: `ExecuteSceneCommand.java` line 54, `f20351p = {-17,17,2}` = `{0xEF,0x11,0x02}` - this
  array is the payload's own leading bytes, not cync-lan's outer `op_code` (see CORRECTION above).
  Payload (`x()` lines 198-207): `[sceneId(1 byte, 0-255), 0x01]`, now prefixed with `0xEF` as
  `devices.py`'s `execute_scene()` sends it: `[0xEF, 0x11, 0x02, sceneId, 0x01]` (5 bytes),
  `repeat_op_code=False`. Scenes are scoped **per-home** (`Location`), not per-group
  (`SceneModel.java` line 96: `SceneId(id, locationId)`).
- The `0x1E` byte from the original ask is real but belongs to a **separate legacy dispatch path**
  for non-mesh device types (`ExecuteSceneCommand.g()` line 179,
  `xlinkCommandDelegate.g((byte) 30, ...)`) — a distinct xlink call, not confirmed to be cync-lan's
  `cmd_code`. Treat as a separate legacy opcode, not part of the mesh-command family above.
- `cmd_code = 0x0C` is **predicted**, not confirmed against a live capture.

### Indicator LED ring — `op_code = 0x8E`, `cmd_code = 0x0E` — **CONFIRMED WORKING on real hardware**

**WIRED IN, CONFIRMED**: `devices.py`'s `set_indicator_led()` was tested against real hardware with
the original `op=0xF7` guess and came back a total no-op; re-tested after the `0x8E`
correction (see CORRECTION above) and **the user confirmed it works**. Both `op_code` (`0x8E`) and
`cmd_code` (`0x0E`) are now proven for this command, not just predicted -
`_warn_experimental_cmd_code` was removed from `set_indicator_led()` accordingly. Exposed via the
`cync_lan.experimental_set_indicator_led` HA service (service name kept as-is - renaming would
break any automation already built against it - but its description text now says "confirmed
working" instead of "predicted, not confirmed").

**UPDATE, later this session**: also exposed as 4 real HA config entities - `select.py`'s
`CyncLanIndicatorLedModeSelect`/`CyncLanIndicatorLedColorSelect`, `number.py`'s
`CyncLanIndicatorLedBrightness`, `switch.py`'s `CyncLanIndicatorLedWifiBlinkSwitch` - rather than
only the raw service, following an audit of Home Assistant's own docs on when a service call should
be a real entity instead (`assumed_state`/`EntityCategory.CONFIG` are HA's documented pattern for
exactly this "can command, can't read back" situation). Both surfaces converge on one shared
per-device cache in `bridge.py` (`IndicatorLedState`/`set_indicator_led_field`) so a service call
and an entity write can never diverge. The service stays for backward compatibility.

This confirmation is also indirect evidence *for* the sibling commands below (motion sensor
settings, scenes): it proves the `0x8E` op, the `repeat_op_code=False` envelope shape, and the
length-formula `cmd_code` prediction methodology all hold for at least one real command in this
family - but their own specific `cmd_code` values are still unconfirmed until tested individually.

Same underlying payload-prefix family as motion-sensor settings (`0xF7 0x11 0x02`), sibling
sub-command - both now correctly sent under the shared `0x8E` outer op.

- Confirmed: `SetStatusIndicatorSettingsCommand.java` (`OPCODE_BYTES = {-9,17,2,6}` - this array is
  the payload's own leading bytes, not cync-lan's outer `op_code`, see CORRECTION above),
  `StatusIndicatorSettings.java`, `LEDIndicatorMode.java`/`LEDIndicatorColor.java`. Payload builder
  `Q()`: `[(mode<<4)|color, brightness(1-100), wifi_disconnect_flag(0/1)]` after the 4-byte opcode
  array - `devices.py` now sends the full array (`0xF7,0x11,0x02,0x06`) + these 3 bytes as one
  7-byte payload under `op_code=0x8E`, `repeat_op_code=False`. `LEDIndicatorMode`: ALWAYS_ON=0,
  ALWAYS_OFF=1, NORMAL=2. `LEDIndicatorColor`: WHITE=0, RED=1, GREEN=2, BLUE=3 (a 4-value enum, not
  full RGB).
- "WiFi-disconnect toggle" is **not a separate feature** — it's byte index 3 of this same payload
  (blink-on-disconnect flag for the indicator LED), not a device behavior setting for what happens
  functionally when WiFi drops. No evidence anywhere in the decompile of an actual
  network-loss-behavior command.
- `cmd_code = 0x0E` is **predicted**, not confirmed against a live capture.
- Both this command and motion-sensor settings were traced down into the app's shared BTLE
  delegate interface (`XlinkCommandDelegate.java`, `h(byte[] payload, MeshAddress, msgId, msgId2,
  Continuation)`) — confirmed that layer carries no field resembling `cmd_code` either. Reinforces
  the "TCP relay-specific, not mesh-layer" theory above, but see the "not yet checked" note in that
  section — this was the BTLE GATT delegate specifically, not any TCP/cloud-relay equivalent. This
  same delegate interface is also what routes both commands (and `ExecuteSceneCommand`) into the
  hardcoded `0x8E` op via `XlinkDeviceManager.CommandDelegate.h()` - see CORRECTION above.
- Worth a follow-up read: `com/savantsystems/oneapp/domain/devices/model/Component.java:2845`
  (`LightRingIndicator`) — a second, UI-level mode/brightness/color enum
  (`LightRingIndicatorMode`) distinct from `LEDIndicatorMode`, translated via
  `LightRingIndicatorModeToLEDIndicatorModeMapper` — unclear if it maps 1:1 or adds states.

### Motion-sensor schedule write — payload leads with `0xF7`, sub-command `0x0B` — **WIRED IN, EXPERIMENTAL**

Third sibling in the `0xF7 0x11 0x02` family (alongside motion/ambient settings at `0x07` and
indicator LED at `0x06`). Writes one of a group's 4 fixed motion-sensor schedule slots — see
"Cync-native automations (scenes, schedules, motion-sensor schedules)" below for the full data
model this command writes.

- Confirmed: `SetMotionSensorScheduleCommand.java` lines 85-193, `OPCODE_BYTES = {0xF7,0x11,0x02,0x0B}`.
  Real outer op is the same hardcoded `0x8E` already confirmed working on real hardware for
  indicator LED - `SetMotionSensorScheduleCommand.java:129-130` routes through the identical
  `XlinkCommandDelegate.DefaultImpls.c`→`h()` path. `devices.py`'s `set_motion_sensor_schedule()`
  implements this with `op_code=0x8E`, `repeat_op_code=False`, `0xF7` prepended to the payload -
  same pattern as `set_indicator_led()`/`set_motion_sensor_settings()`.
- **Full payload, resolved to the exact bit level** (`m14101x()`, lines 163-202): 4-byte
  discriminator array (`0xF7,0x11,0x02,0x0B`) + a flags byte + start_hour + start_minute + end_hour
  + end_minute + brightness + 3 color bytes = 13 bytes total.
  - Flags byte: `slot_id (bits 0-1, 0-3) | mode_bit | rgb_flag`. Mode bits (from the app's own
    if/else-if chain, NOT derived from `MotionSensorResponseMode.java`'s ordinals):
    DISABLED→`0x80`, OCCUPANCY→`0x00` (no bit, the implicit else case), VACANCY→`0x20`,
    SIMPLE→`0x10`. `rgb_flag = 0x40` when using RGB color (independent bit, combines with any
    mode). Bits 2-3 are never touched by any code path - confirmed reserved/always-0, not a gap.
  - `start_hour`/`end_hour`: 0-23. `start_minute`/`end_minute`: 0-59. Plain `LocalTime`
    hour/minute, big-endian order.
  - `brightness`: 0-100, range-checked in the app itself (`SensorSchedule2.java:182-195`).
  - Color tail (always 3 bytes): CCT → `[pct, 0x00, 0x00]` (0=warmest, 100=coolest, matches the
    cloud-JSON `cct` field 1:1); RGB → `[r, g, b]`, each 0-255. `RevealColor` throws
    `UnsupportedOperationException` in the app - not encodable, not offered by `devices.py`.
  - Slot id mapping confirmed identical to the already-decoded cloud-JSON model
    (`MotionSensorMappersKt.m13647a`): Morning=0, Daytime=1, Evening=2, Sleep=3.
- `cmd_code = 0x14` is **predicted** via the length formula (`7 + 13 = 20 = 0x14`) - reproduces
  exactly for both confirmed 0x8E-family siblings (indicator LED `7+7=0x0E`, motion settings
  `7+12=0x13`) but is not itself independently confirmed against a live capture.
- **Targeted at an individual device, not a group MeshAddress** - confirmed via
  `MotionSensorServiceDefault.java`'s `writeSchedule()` (~lines 894-1010): the real app resolves a
  group's member devices and fans this command out per-device, rather than ever sending it once to
  a synthesized group address. `devices.py`'s `set_motion_sensor_schedule()` is accordingly a
  `CyncDevice` instance method (targets `self.id`), not a module-level group-targeted function like
  `set_group_power()` - a genuinely different targeting model from the group-power finding above,
  confirmed independently rather than assumed to match.
- Exposed as `cync_lan.experimental_set_motion_sensor_schedule` (`custom_components/cync_lan/
  services.py`) - **never itself tested against real hardware**, unlike indicator LED. The outer
  op/payload-shape confidence transfers from the sibling commands' confirmation, but this specific
  command's own behavior is unverified.
- **Operational prerequisite, RESOLVED**: same physical-wake requirement as motion sensor settings
  above (hold the off button ~5s until the LED turns green = the device's ordinary mesh online
  status, same signal as `bridge.is_online(dev_id)`) - see "Operational prerequisite: motion
  sensors must be woken before settings/schedule writes" further below for the full research trail.
- **This is a write-side finding that doesn't need a cloud API at all** — it's a local mesh command,
  architecturally identical to every other opcode cync-lan already speaks. See the automations doc
  for why that matters for a HA-automation-to-Cync-device sync feature.

### Operational prerequisite: motion sensors must be woken before settings/schedule writes — RESOLVED against decompiled source

Originally user-reported from real Cync app usage, now independently confirmed via a full
decompiled-source research pass: to edit a motion sensor's settings in the real Cync app, the
physical device must first be woken up by pressing and holding its off button for 5 seconds until
the indicator LED turns solid green. Exact user-facing copy, `strings.xml:2354`:

> Press and hold the off button for 5 seconds to wake the device & make it discoverable. The LED
> light will turn green. Make sure your phone is within 40 feet of the device during this
> process.

Shown by `DeviceSettingsWakeUpFragment.B0()` (`DeviceSettingsWakeUpFragment.java:158-180`), shared
verbatim by 3 battery/sleep device classes (`DeviceClassification.java`: WirelessSwitch=15,
Remote=17, MotionSensor=18) - only the Lottie animation differs per device type. **Don't confuse
with commissioning's separate "setup mode" copy** (`strings.xml:1271-1275`, blinking **blue**,
shown only during first-time device add) - this is a different flow with different LED color.

**"Discoverable" is not a BLE/GATT state at all — it's the device's ordinary mesh online/offline
status**, the same `AvailabilityState` StateFlow every device type (lights, switches, sensors)
already reports. Confirmed via `MotionSensorServiceDefault.isOnline()`
(`MotionSensorServiceDefault.java:2607-2637`) → `DeviceManager.i(): StateFlow<AvailabilityState>`
(`DeviceManager.java:60`) → `AvailabilityState.Online` (`AvailabilityState.java:66-89`, a plain
sealed-class member alongside `Offline`/`Establishing`/`NoLink`/`None` - no special "discoverable"
variant exists). The wake-up screen's own gating logic
(`DeviceSettingsWakeUpFragment.java:179`) just reactively watches this same status flow flip to
connected - it runs no dedicated discovery/BLE-scan routine of its own. **This means cync-lan
already has the exact equivalent signal**: `bridge.is_online(dev_id)` (driven by the real
online/offline status packets `CyncLanEntity.available` already reads) is the same underlying
concept the real app checks before allowing an edit.

**No programmatic wake command exists** - exhaustively searched `com.gelighting.cbygekit` and
`com.savantsystems.oneapp` (the entire GE/Cync source) for "wake"/"discoverable"/"pairing
mode"/"config mode"; the only hits are in an unrelated bundled Tuya SDK and generic
Bluetooth-mesh-provisioning classes, neither wired to Cync/GE motion sensor code.
`MotionSensorService`'s full interface (`MotionSensorService.java`) has no such method. **A
previous lead in this doc, `BleDeviceCommissionService.checkMotionSensorOperation`, was
investigated and is a false lead** - it fires during initial multi-device commissioning to
re-home a sensor's "smart operation" group mapping, unrelated to wake/discoverability; not worth
re-investigating.

**A real, load-bearing finding for cync-lan's own behavior**: the real app's
`MotionSensorServiceDefault.D()`/`.B()` (writeSettings/writeSchedule) check `isOnline()` per
target device and **silently return `Ok(Unit)` — fake success — without ever transmitting the
command if the device is offline**, rather than surfacing an error. If cync-lan wants to match
real-ecosystem behavior (and give better UX than the real app does), an HA-side flow should check
`bridge.is_online(dev_id)` *before* calling `set_motion_sensor_settings()`/
`set_motion_sensor_schedule()` and tell the user to wake the device, rather than sending blind and
getting the same silent no-op the real app itself produces when the target is asleep - see
[[project_sensor_wake_prerequisite]] (agent memory) and `feedback_opcode_debugging.md`'s general
"silent mesh-command failures" note, which this confirms applies architecturally, not just as an
unverified byte-guess risk.

Full research trail: `/private/tmp/claude-501/.../scratchpad/jadx_out/BleDeviceCommissionService_fallback.java`
and `MotionSensorServiceDefault_fallback.java` (raw `jadx -m fallback --single-class` dumps of two
methods JADX's normal pass couldn't render) - not committed to this repo, regenerate from
`/Users/proxy-alt/Downloads/cync_apk`'s `classes*.dex` if needed again.

Not a protocol command at all. `MultiWayMode.java` is a plain boolean
`SimpleDeviceSpecificProperty`; `SetMultiWayModeGeCommandHandler.java` only mutates the in-memory
cloud `DeviceModel` and notifies `SceneService` if enabling — no BTLE/TCP write is built anywhere.
Confirmed via `OperationManager.java:840-845` and `MappersKt.java:815-823`: it round-trips purely
through `LocationSnapshot`/`DeviceItem` cloud serialization (`deviceItem.V`), set at commissioning
time (`CommissioningMultiWayModeFragment`, `MultiWayModeFragment`). If cync-lan wants this, it
would need to come from the cloud export data, not a device packet — worth checking whether
`cloud_api.py`'s existing export already captures this field under some `deviceItem` key.

## Device type coverage — closed

Audited against `DeviceType.java`'s sealed-class registry (155 real numeric IDs, the app's own
`deviceTypeByValue` companion-object map — confirmed authoritative, it's literally what the real
app uses to resolve a cloud `deviceType` int). All 155 are already keys in
`src/cync_lan/metadata/model_info.py`'s `device_type_map` (156 keys total; the one extra,
`85` = "Tunable White Light (Unknown)", appears to be from a real capture rather than the app's
static enum, not a gap). Camera types (240/241/242) are present and correctly marked
`UNKNOWN`/`supported=False` — different transport, intentionally out of scope. No further work
needed here unless a newer app build adds types.

## Hub command family — 8 further confirmed op_codes, extracted but not wired in

Found by sweeping every class in `com/gelighting/cbygekit/services/devices/command/` for a real
dispatch byte rather than for the opcode arrays those classes also carry. None of these eight
appear anywhere in this repo's docs or `src/` today.

**These op_codes are real, and for a specific reason.** All eight dispatch through
`XlinkTranslatorKt.m14449a(seq, (byte) op, writeBuffer)` — the same call shape as
`add_automation`'s already-confirmed `0x95` (see `devices.py`'s `add_automation` docstring:
"real op_code (byte)-107 = 0x95"). On this hub/xlink path the byte argument **is** the outer
op_code. That is *not* the same as the `0x8E`-family trap in the CORRECTION section above, where
a command class's own `{0xEF,0x11,0x02}` array is the leading bytes of a payload and the real
outer op is hardcoded elsewhere. Every entry below was read from the dispatch call, not from an
opcode array.

`WriteBuffer` widths, from `services/devices/xlink/legacy/WriteBuffer.java`:
`m14441a()` = 1 byte, `m14442b()` = raw byte array, `m14443c()` = **4-byte LE**,
`m14444d()` = **2-byte LE**. Buffers are allocated zero-filled and the whole array is sent, so an
under-filled buffer goes out with trailing zero padding — the allocation size is the wire size.

| op_code | Command class | Request payload | Response |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `0x32` | `DeleteGroupHubCommand` | 2 B — `groupAddress` (u16 LE) | none |
| `0x46` | `QueryDeviceTimeCommand` | 64 B, all zero | `DeviceTimeNotification` |
| `0x49` | `QueryHubFirmwareUpdatesCommand` | 32 B, all zero | `HubFirmwareUpdatesNotification` |
| `0x4B` | `QueryHubInfoCommand` | 64 B, all zero | `HubInfoNotification` |
| `0x4F` | `StartHubFirmwareUpdatesCommand` | 32 B — `0x00` + `{0x00,0x00}` or `{0xFF,0xFF}` | `HubFirmwareUpdateStatusNotification` |
| `0x8A` | `QueryHubMeshNameAndPasswordCommand` | 64 B, all zero | `HubMeshNameAndPasswordNotification` |
| `0x97` | `DeleteAutomationHubCommand` | 6 B — `scheduleId` (u16 LE) + 4 zero bytes | none |
| `0xAD` | `QuerySolConfigCommand` | 64 B, all zero | `SolConfigNotification` |

Confidence: **confirmed** for op_code and request payload (read from decompiled dispatch +
`WriteBuffer` calls). **Not** hardware-tested — none of these is wired into `devices.py`, and the
`cmd_code` for each would still need the length formula from "TCP relay envelope research" above.

### Implementation status

`0x32`, `0x46`, `0x4B`, `0x8A`, `0x97` and `0xAD` are wired into `devices.py`
as of cync-lan 0.3.0.

`0x49` `QueryHubFirmwareUpdates` is **deliberately not implemented**. Its
reply is not a fixed record like the others: `HubFirmwareUpdatesNotification`
reads a status byte and three 2-byte counters, then a variable-length list of
per-device entries each carrying a 2-byte id and two 10-byte version strings.
Getting the field order or the record stride wrong yields plausible-looking
garbage rather than an obvious failure, and there is no capture to check a
decoder against - so it stays documented rather than guessed at.

The three firmware-*applying* commands (`0x4F` `StartHubFirmwareUpdates`,
`StartWifiOtaUpdate`, `SetWifiOtaUpdateMode`) are **intentionally absent from
the codebase entirely**, not merely unwired. Everywhere else in this family a
wrong predicted `cmd_code` means the device ignores the packet; these flash
firmware, where the same mistake has a much worse floor. They stay documented
until someone confirms the envelope against a real packet capture.

### The two write commands

`0x97` `DeleteAutomationHubCommand` closes an obvious asymmetry: this repo already implements
`create_schedule` (`0x92`), `toggle_automation` (`0x93`) and `delete_schedule` (`0x94`), but has
no way to remove the *automation* (the trigger binding created by `add_automation`/`0x95`). The
payload is a 6-byte buffer with only `m14444d(scheduleId)` written, so bytes 2-5 are zero — the
same 6-byte frame shape as its siblings, not a 2-byte command.

`0x32` `DeleteGroupHubCommand` takes a group `MeshAddress` as `UShort`, matching
`MeshAddress.java`'s `GROUP_ADDRESS_RANGE = 32768 until 65535` already documented in
"Groups control" above. It is the delete counterpart to the `0xD7` membership command.

### Response layouts, decoded

Read from each notification's `XlinkParser.mo14294a()`. All parse little-endian.

**`0x8A` → `HubMeshNameAndPasswordNotification`** — two fixed 48-byte fields, 96 bytes total:

```
[0..47]   mesh name      (48 B, ASCII, NUL-padded)
[48..95]  mesh password  (48 B, ASCII, NUL-padded)
```

This is the most directly useful of the eight. `src/cync_lan/ble_provision.py` currently requires
`FACTORY_MESH_NAME`/`FACTORY_MESH_PASSWORD` because it can only provision a factory-default
device; `key_encrypt()` and `generate_sk()` both derive from exactly these two values. A hub that
answers `0x8A` would hand over an *already-provisioned* mesh's credentials over the LAN.

**`0x4B` → `HubInfoNotification`** — four fixed 16-byte ASCII fields, 64 bytes total:

```
[0..15]   firmware version, major part
[16..31]  firmware version, minor part   -> joined as "{major}.{minor}"
[32..47]  MAC address     (parsed via MacAddress.Companion)
[48..63]  setup code
```

**`0x46` → `DeviceTimeNotification`** (Xlink parser — 7 bytes read):

```
[0..1]  year   (u16 LE)
[2]     month
[3]     day
[4]     hour
[5]     minute
[6]     second
```

Note the app also has a *Telink* parser for the same notification reading a different layout
(offsets 10-19, adding a DST flag at byte 17 — `0xA1` true / `0xA0` false — and a packed
`ZoneOffset` at 18-19). Only the Xlink layout above applies to this repo's TCP path; the Telink
one is the BTLE-direct path and is noted here only so the two are not confused.

## Open threads for future research

1. ~~Find the app's TCP/cloud-relay outer-envelope builder~~ — **done**, see "TCP relay envelope
   research" above: `cmd_code = 7 + len(op_code_byte + full_payload)`, verified 3/3 against
   already-confirmed production values.
2. ~~Wire up every "blocked: `cmd_code`" command using the formula from step 1~~ — **done**: fine/fade
   brightness, indicator LED, scenes, and motion/ambient sensor settings are all wired into real
   sends now, exposed as `cync_lan.experimental_*` HA services (`custom_components/cync_lan/
   services.py`). None of these are independently confirmed against a live capture (the formula's
   source class is `@Deprecated` in the app) - **the highest-value remaining step is real-world
   testing/reporting from users**, not further research, now that the plumbing exists.
3. ~~Group control needs real protocol research, not just address-targeting~~ — **resolved and
   wired in**: `target_id`/`sub_id` were never independent fields, together they already form the
   outer envelope's 2-byte MeshAddress, so group addresses need zero `PacketBuilder` changes - see
   the Groups section above's second correction. `cync_lan.experimental_set_group_power` is wired
   in and needs real-hardware testing to confirm device firmware actually honors a group-range
   target, same as every other experimental command in this doc.
4. A real packet capture (MITM of a device's TCP session, which cync-lan's DNS-redirect setup
   already positions for) remains the way to fully confirm the length-field formula, resolve group
   control, and cover Scenes'/Schedules' write path (not yet analyzed - see docs/cync_automations.md).
5. **Whether the official app's cloud dependency (and, further out, new-device provisioning) could
   ever be fully replaced by a self-hosted server** - see docs/cloud_independence_research.md. The
   app's own device-control channel turns out to be just as unauthenticated as device firmware,
   BLE-provisioned device identity is confirmed client-side, and a follow-up pass (native library
   triage + a targeted re-decompile) confirmed the BLE pairing/session-key crypto is local-only too
   (mesh credentials come from an already-paired hub over BLE or are locally synthesized, no
   server-issued secret found anywhere). Remaining: a live BLE capture would still be the only way
   to get 100% certainty, but it's now a confirmatory step, not resolving an open blocker.

## BTLE mesh provisioning & MeshInfo details

**MeshInfo request pagination — confirmed, and resolves one `cmd_code` for free.**
`QueryMeshStatusCommand.java` (opcode `82` = `0x52`, sent via
`xlinkCommandDelegate.g((byte) 82, ...)`) builds a 6-byte payload: 2 reserved zero bytes + `total`
(2B little-endian, `-1`/`0xFFFF` = "all devices") + `offset` (2B little-endian, pagination start
index). This matches cync-lan's `build_mesh_info_request` payload byte-for-byte
(`00 00 FF FF 00 00` after `F8 52 06`) — confirming `cmd_code = 0x06` for this command specifically,
and that a targeted re-query (fewer devices, or resuming at an offset) is possible by varying
`total`/`offset` instead of always requesting the full mesh.

**24-byte MeshInfo entry struct — cross-confirmed, plus one unparsed field found.**
`MeshStatusNotification.XlinkParsers.DeviceStatusPagesParser.d()` (the "WifiProxy"/bridge-relay
parser variant, as opposed to sibling method `.c()` for BTLE-hub-relayed reports, which uses
different offsets and isn't cync-lan's path) reads: address `dataBytes.d(0)` (2-byte short, not the
1-byte `dev_id` cync-lan currently reads — safe for base addresses 1-255 but would truncate a
nonzero high "element ID" byte, see below), a boolean flag at **byte 3** (not currently parsed by
cync-lan — feeds into the on/off determination alongside byte 8), power state at byte 8, brightness
at byte 12, color-mode/temp discriminator at byte 16, and RGB at byte 20-22 — all exactly matching
`_process_73_mesh_info`'s existing `dev_state/dev_bri/dev_tmp/dev_r,g,b` offsets in `devices.py:2141-2146`.

**Mesh addressing — confirmed, broader than the group-range note already in this doc.**
`MeshAddress.java`: a `MeshAddress` is one 16-bit value = `base_address | (element_id << 8)`
(`Companion.a()`, ~line 60), where `base_address` is 1-254 (`DEVICE_BASE_ADDRESS_RANGE`) and
`element_id` is 0-126 (`DEVICE_ELEMENT_ID_RANGE`, 0 = "no sub-element"). This means multi-gang
devices can be individually addressed via the address's high byte, a second mechanism alongside the
brightness-byte bitmask cync-lan already uses for `MULTI_ENDPOINT_TYPES`/type 67 — not currently
exercised by cync-lan, but relevant if a future device type needs per-gang targeting. Also confirmed:
broadcast address = `0xFFFF` (`MeshAddress.f` = 65535) and `0x0000` (`MeshAddress.f18318g`) is a
"none/self/unassigned" sentinel. `GROUP_ADDRESS_RANGE` (32768-65535) matches this doc's existing
Groups section exactly.

**Provisioning/commissioning — confirmed to be WiFi-credential handoff, not BTLE mesh key exchange.**
`GECommissioningDataSource.g()` builds each device's commission record via
`SetWifiResponseModel(ssid, mac, encryptionType, ...)` — i.e. "add device" hands the device the
home's WiFi SSID/password, it's the device firmware that joins the WiFi/mesh, not the app running a
Bluetooth-SIG mesh provisioning exchange. **Not found**: no `NetworkKeyCommand`/`PairingCommand`/
`MeshProvisioner` equivalent exists under `com/gelighting/cbygekit/` — those class names only exist
under `com/thingclips/sdk/{bluetooth,sigmesh}` (Tuya/ThingClips SDK bundled for unrelated product
lines, not reachable from GE/Cync's `GECommissioningDataSource`).

**CORRECTION, later session**: `CommissionBuilder.java` alone only manages cloud-side
Location/Group/Subgroup placement, as noted above - but a more thorough pass found the actual
per-device mesh-address allocation this doc previously said wasn't in the app. It's local, not
device/bridge-side. See `docs/cloud_independence_research.md`'s "BLE provisioning" section for the
full writeup - short version: `BaseNonHubDeviceCommissionService.y()` (`setMeshAddressOperation`,
step 6 of a 20-step BLE commissioning pipeline) constructs each device's `MeshAddress` locally in
the app, and `DeviceId.Companion.b(macAddress)` derives `deviceID` as `"{MAC}.{index}"` - also
local, from the MAC read directly off the device over BLE. Neither requires a cloud round trip. The
single cloud call in the pipeline (`writeChangesToCloudOperation`, step 12) comes after both of
these and reads as a "sync what I already decided" write, not an identity-issuing call.
