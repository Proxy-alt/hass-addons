    0xD0/0x0D exactly, byte-for-byte (see the "Confirmed, already shipping
    in production" table in docs/mesh_opcodes.md). What's unconfirmed is the
    ADDRESSING itself.

    A real-hardware trace found `broadcast_control_command`'s `target_id`
    and `sub_id` parameters were never two independent fields - together
    they already ARE the outer envelope's one 2-byte little-endian
    MeshAddress (`target_id` = low byte, `sub_id` = high byte). Every
    existing single-device command just always hardcodes sub_id=0x00,
    which happens to also be correct for non-multi-gang devices, so nobody
    noticed the high byte was live. Group addresses (32768-65535, exactly
    the `group_id` key cync-lan's own parsed `groups` dict already uses -
    see cloud_api.py's `raw_group["groupID"]`) fit entirely inside that same
    16-bit space - splitting one into (target_id, sub_id) needs no
    PacketBuilder changes at all, since `_require_u8` already accepts any
    byte 0-255 in both fields.

    What's NOT confirmed: whether device firmware actually treats a
    group-range target as "respond as the whole group" - the one real 0x8E
    packet capture available used broadcast 0xFFFF, which is byte-identical
    under both the old and new addressing model and doesn't independently
    prove this. Separately, the app's own multi-device command path looks
    like a per-device fan-out loop, not evidence it ever relies on a true
    group broadcast. See docs/mesh_opcodes.md's "Groups control" section.

    ExecuteSceneCommand's actual send path in the decompiled app

    UPDATE, follow-up research: traced this command's one real call site,
    RoutinesService.applyScheduleEnabled() - it picks between

    ToggleAutomationCommand based on whether a WiFi hub device controller

    mesh devices) always has a WiFi hub in this sense, this is the branch

        Confirmed via ControlDeviceGroupCommand.java (decompiled app,
        base class for AddDeviceGroupCommand/RemoveDeviceGroupCommand):
        op_code array `{-41,17,2}` = `{0xD7,0x11,0x02}` (`:120`). Payload

        receive-only reachability, RXTX=0x00 for normal full participation
        - defaults to RXTX, matching how every other already-wired command
        in this file addresses devices).

        **UPDATE, corrected after follow-up research**: the command is
        genuinely dual-path, branching on
        `xlinkCommandDelegate.getDeviceType().getProductType().f31219d`
        (`ControlDeviceGroupCommand.java:192`) - confirmed this flag means
        "is this device's ProductType Sol or C-Reach" (an "is this a Hub
        product" flag in the SDK's own terms, `ProductType.java:195-199`),
        NOT a generic hub-relay/BLE-vs-WiFi distinction as first assumed.
        cync-lan already tracks the exact same distinction via
        `is_sol_lamp` (`metadata.opcodes.sol_lamp`, currently true only for
        device type 80). The ORIGINAL version of this method always took
        the `is_sol_lamp=True` branch (real `op=0xD7` via the trustworthy
        `XlinkCommandDelegate.f()`/`mo14054f()` envelope) - correct only
        for that rare product family. For every other real device
        (`is_sol_lamp=False`, virtually all real Cync hardware), the SDK
        instead routes through `h()`/`mo14056h` - the same `0x8E`
        "mesh-relay" substitution bug as set_indicator_led/
        set_motion_sensor_settings/etc. - meaning the embedded `0xD7` is
        actually just the payload's own leading discriminator byte, not
        the real outer op. See docs/mesh_opcodes.md's "Groups control"
        section.

        cmd_ is PREDICTED via the length formula in both branches (see
        docs/mesh_opcodes.md's "TCP relay envelope research") - not itself
        confirmed against a live capture, unlike the op_code/dispatch
        method. Unlike set_group_power, this targets an individual
        device's own address (self.id) - the payload's 2-byte group
        address is data, not the addressing field; it's the app telling
        one specific device "start/stop listening on this group's pub/sub
        address," not a broadcast to the group.

        group_id: 32768-65535 (cync-lan's own group-address range, same
        range as set_group_power's group_id).
        member: True to add this device to the group, False to remove it.

        discriminator byte this originally-misread-as-op-code value turned
        out to actually be (see that method's docstring).

        Sourced from decompiling the current Cync Android app
        (MotionSensorSetting.java / SetMotionSensorSettingsCommand.java) -
        the shape below (SetMotionSensorSettingsCommand's own opcode array
        `{-9,17,2,7}`, i.e. `{0xF7,0x11,0x02,0x07}`) is confirmed against
        the decompiled app, cross-checked independently twice. What was
        NOT initially confirmed: that first 0xF7 byte was assumed to be
        cync-lan's own outer `op` argument (the "opcode + fixed VendorID
        prefix" pattern set_power/set_brightness use) - a real-hardware
        test proved that wrong (see set_motion_sensor_settings()).

        `cmd_` (the second envelope argument send_command()/build_control_packet()
        expects - see set_power/set_brightness/set_rgb for that pattern) was
        long unconfirmed: it has no equivalent field in any of the decompiled
        per-command byte arrays (those only cover the *inner* mesh command,
        not cync-lan's own outer envelope). It's since been PREDICTED (0x13)
        via the length formula in docs/mesh_opcodes.md's "TCP relay envelope
        research" (validated 3/3 against already-confirmed production
        commands, but the source class it's derived from is itself flagged
        @Deprecated in the decompiled app) - see set_motion_sensor_settings(),
        which wires this payload into a real, EXPERIMENTAL send.

        Wire format: VendorID (0x11 0x02) + sub-opcode (0x07, fixed - marks
        "sensor settings" as a command family) + an 8-byte params struct:

        Corrected after a real-hardware test of this command's sibling
        set_indicator_led (same command family) came back a total no-op:

        Plug - Toggle Power/Plug.md) - see
        PacketBuilder.build_control_packet's repeat_op_code param.

        Operational prerequisite, RESOLVED against decompiled source: the
        real Cync app requires physically waking the sensor first (press
        and hold its off button ~5s until the LED turns green) before it
        accepts settings edits. Confirmed this "discoverable" gate is just
        the device's ordinary mesh online/offline status (real app checks
        MotionSensorServiceDefault.isOnline(), same StateFlow every device
        type reports) - not a BLE/GATT discoverability scan, and no
        programmatic wake command exists anywhere in the app's source. The
        real app's own writeSettings/writeSchedule silently return fake
        success without transmitting anything if the target is offline -
        callers of this method should check bridge/online status first
        (the equivalent signal cync-lan already tracks) rather than send
        blind. See docs/mesh_opcodes.md's "Operational prerequisite"

        """EXPERIMENTAL: sets the device's small status/indicator LED
        (mode/color/brightness) via sub-command 0x06
        (SetStatusIndicatorSettingsCommand, confirmed payload shape) -
        distinct from the device's main light output.

        mode: 0=always on, 1=always off, 2=normal (confirmed,
        LEDIndicatorMode.java). color: 0=white, 1=red, 2=green, 3=blue -
        a 4-value enum, not full RGB (confirmed, LEDIndicatorColor.java).
        brightness: 1-100. wifi_disconnect_blink: blink the indicator when
        WiFi is disconnected.

        A real-hardware test of this exact command with the original guess
        (`op=0xF7`) came back a total no-op (device did nothing, no error -
        fire-and-forget, no ACK checked). Root cause: SetStatusIndicatorSettingsCommand's
        own "opcode array" `{0xF7,0x11,0x02,0x06}` was misread as cync-lan's
        outer `op` (0xF7) + a payload starting `0x11,0x02,0x06,...`.
        Tracing the actual send path in the decompiled app
        (XlinkDeviceManager.CommandDelegate.h()) showed the real outer op
        is a hardcoded 0x8E "mesh-relay" op used across several command
        types (indicator LED, motion sensor settings, scenes) - the 0xF7
        is just that array's own leading byte, i.e. part of the payload,
        not cync-lan's envelope op. Independently corroborated against a
        real captured packet (docs/debugging_sessions/3 devices/
        Plug - Toggle Power/Plug.md): its checksum only balances with
        op=0x8E and no repeated op_code byte before the payload - see
        PacketBuilder.build_control_packet's repeat_op_code param.

        CONFIRMED WORKING on real hardware with the corrected op/payload
        shape below (op=0x8E, cmd_=0x0E, repeat_op_code=False) - no longer
        flagged via _warn_experimental_cmd_code, since both op_code and
        cmd_code are now proven, not predicted. See docs/mesh_opcodes.md.
